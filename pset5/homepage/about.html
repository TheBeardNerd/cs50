                <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in technology. From tinkering with my personal computers
                to playing computer games to programming and "trading" programs on my TI-83 calculator in high school, learning new ways
                to utilize technology has always been important to me. Enter my eldest brother (who also took CS50), Tech901, and CS50.
                Through encouragement from my brother, an incredible learning environment from Tech901, and a wonderful curriculum from CS50
                I have been able to elevate my software development skills to a new level in a short period of time.</p>
